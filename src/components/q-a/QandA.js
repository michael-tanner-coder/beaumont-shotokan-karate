              The cost of your gi, karate uniform, is just $20.00. If you have
              participated in a martial art prior to joining our dojo, and
              already have a gi, that is acceptable as long as it is white and
              unadorned.{" "}

                We encourage all students to purchase this valuable resource,
                which includes testing information, Japanese terminology, and
                more. Handbooks can be ordered from Sensei for $10.

                At the rank of yellow belt, students who wish to participate in
                sparring must purchase protective gear. Children require full
                gear, while adults may spar with only hand pads. We want to get
                you the best possible deal on gear while buying high quality
                equipment; therefore, we sell the gear to you at our cost.
                Children’s gear will cost approximately $40.00 for female
                students and $45.00 for male students. Adult hand pads are
                $20.00.

                cost for each of these events varies, and while we do encourage
                our students to attend these events, they are NOT required.{" "}
